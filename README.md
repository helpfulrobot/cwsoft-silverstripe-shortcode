# cwsoft-shortcode module for CMS SilverStripe 3.x
This module provides some handy shortcode methods ready to use from your [SilverStripe CMS <= v3.1.1](http://silverstripe.org) WYSIWYG editor.

The `cwsoft-shortcode` module builds up on the shortcode function first introduced with SilverStripe 2.4. Shortcodes can best be thought of a kind of placeholders entered in the WYSIWYG editor, which gets replaced with PHP output just before beeing displayed on the screen. This allows to add dynamic content to a specific position inside a WYSIWYG page. The available cwsoft-shortcode methods can easily be selected from the WYSIWYG editor.

### Shortcode: [cwsHideMailto]
This shortcode allows you to obfuscate a mail address or a mailto link from beeing harvested by spam bots. This is done by replacing the characters "@" and "." of mail addresses with "(at)" and "(dot)". In addition the mailto link part will be encrypted with a simple Javascript Caeser cipher and automatically decrypted into human readable format when openend in an E-Mail program. This shortcode can be used in two different ways.

	[cwsHideMailto email='yourmail@domain.com' subject='optional_mail_subject']mail_link_text[/cwsHideMailto]
	[cwsHideMailto email='yourmail@domain.com' subject='optional_mail_subject']

### Shortcode: [cwsRandomQuote]
This shortcode allows you to displays a random quote from a textfile located in a subfolder in ***/assets***.

	[cwsRandomQuote csv_file="subfolder_in_assets/quotes.csv"]

The textfile containing the quotes must follow the conventions below (***ensure*** that the first line of your CSV file exactly matches the example below, including upper/lower case):

	"Quote"|"Author"
	"your first quote goes here"|"author name"
	"next quote goes here"|"autor of this quote"
	
**Tip:** You can adjust the output to your needs via the template file *cwsoft-shortcode/templates/Include/RandomQuote.ss* and the CSS file *cwsoft-shortcode/css/cwsShortCodeRandomQuote.css*.

### Shortcode: [cwsRandomImage]
This shortcode allows you to display a random image with a jQuery ColorBox effect from a subfolder in ***/assets***.

	[cwsRandomImage folder="subfolder_in_assets" align="left|right"]

**Tip:** You can adjust the output to your needs via the template file *cwsoft-shortcode/templates/Include/RandomImage.ss* and the CSS file *cwsoft-shortcode/css/cwsShortCodeRandomImage.css*.
